# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Summary

The purpose of this project is to map Earthquake data. This project uses JavaScript, GeoJSON, HTML, CSS, the D3.js library, and Mapbox API.
There are multiple layers added to the maps to show the correct data. In the Challenge portion of the assignment, I add a layer for the tectonic plates. I then add major earthquake data to the map, add a color and set a radius based on the magnitude of the earthquake, and add a popup marker for each earthquake that disaplys the magnitude and location of the earthquake using the GeoJSON layer.
